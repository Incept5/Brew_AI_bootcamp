# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Demonstrations

This directory contains a progressive series of demonstrations showcasing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations, from basic concepts to production-ready systems.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems:

1. **Retrieve** relevant information from external documents/databases
2. **Augment** the user's query with this contextual information
3. **Generate** responses using both the query and retrieved context

### Key Components

- **Document Processing**: Text chunking and preprocessing
- **Embeddings**: Converting text to numerical vectors for similarity search
- **Vector Store**: Database for storing and querying embeddings
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant chunks based on query similarity
- **Generation**: LLM produces answers using retrieved context

### Benefits

- Access to current information beyond training data
- Reduced hallucinations through grounded responses
- Domain-specific knowledge without model retraining
- Transparent source attribution

## Architecture Patterns

### Basic Pattern (Demos 1-2)
```
Query → Embedding → Similarity Search → Context → LLM → Response
```

### Persistent Pattern (Demo 3)
```
Query → Embedding → ChromaDB → Enhanced Context → LLM → Response
                  ↑
            Persistent Storage

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Each demo builds upon previous concepts
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance**: Optimization techniques for production use
4. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with multiple query types
6. **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and examples

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama not running**: Ensure `ollama serve` is active
2. **Missing models**: Pull required models with `ollama pull`
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce batch sizes or use smaller models
4. **ChromaDB errors**: Check write permissions in working directory

### Model Alternatives

If default models aren't available, modify the model names in the scripts:
- Embedding models: `all-minilm`, `nomic-embed-text`
- LLM models: `llama3.2`, `qwen2.5`, `mistral`

## Next Steps

After working through these demonstrations, consider:

1. Implementing custom chunking strategies
2. Adding metadata filtering
3. Exploring hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
4. Building web interfaces with Gradio/Streamlit
5. Deploying with FastAPI for production use

Each demonstration serves as a foundation for building more sophisticated RAG applications tailored to specific use cases and requirements.
